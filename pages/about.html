	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>My name is Rebeka and I am a qualified, regestered childminder in Barnet, North West London. I am passionate about childmindig and simply love children and spending time and teaching them. I also have many years of child care experience and I am a successful mum at the same time. Apart from the usual competences I focus on creativity so children usually do arts and crafts with me.</p>
